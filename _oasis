Name:                   resource-pooling
Version:                0.1
Synopsis:               a derivative of Lwt_pool with extensions
Description:            The module Lwt_pool from the lwt package implements
                        resource pooling. With Resource_pool this package
                        provides a modified version with additional features.
                        Also there is a module called Server_pool that manages
                        pools of pools (think about a connection pool to a
                        cluster of servers).
