Name:         resource-pooling
Version:      0.3.1
Synopsis:     library for pooling resources like connections, threads, or similar
Description:  This package is derived from the module Lwt_pool from the lwt
              package, which implements resource pooling. With Resource_pool
              this package provides a modified version with additional
              features. Also there is a module called Server_pool that manages
              resource clusters, specifically a cluster of servers each with
              its own connection pool.
